### Concept
Mods often emulate the nature of a TARDIS; showing that they are more than just a machine. However, currently existing solutions do not allow for the uniqueness an individual TARDIS can display. By incorporating a upgrade tree/perks system, this project will allow the players to shape and build their ship in the way that they would like to see them operate.

Often games will use upgrade trees to emulate the ability and upgrade of the player advancing as gameplay progresses, allowing them to chose and create their own learning narrative. The TARDIS systems aim to do the same thing, allowing players to advance their rather tame/limited TARDIS to match their playstyle. 

The player's progression throughout the mod is presented through the use of a tree, known as the Architectural Configuration System; quite literally a upgrade tree. As the player gains upgrades and experience the tree itself will grow, allowing the player to select newer upgrades to master.
